XLII. This time that is now present, bestow thou upon
thyself. <b>They</b> that rather hunt for fame <b>after</b>
death, do not consider, that <b>those</b> men that shall be
hereafter, will be even such, as these whom now they can so
hardly bear with. And besides they also will be mortal men.
But to consider the thing in itself, if so many with so many
voices, shall make such and such a sound, or shall have such
and such an opinion concerning thee, what is it to thee?
