To a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would
give small satisfaction. Its legends were often childish or
impossible; its teaching had little to do with morality. The
Roman religion was in fact of the nature of a bargain: men
paid certain sacrifices and rites, and the gods granted
their favour, irrespective of right or wrong. In this case
all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they
had <b>been,</b> though to a less extent, in Greece. There
were under the early empire two rival schools which
practically divided the field between them, Stoicism and
Epicureanism. The ideal set before each was nominally much
the same. The Stoics aspired to the repression of all
emotion, and the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance;
yet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn
endurance, the other for unbridled licence. With
Epicureanism we have nothing to do now; but it will be worth
while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect.
Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, was born in Cyprus at some
date unknown, but his life may be said roughly to be between
the years 350 and 250 B.C. Cyprus <b>has</b> been from time
immemorial a meeting-place of the East and West, and
although we cannot grant any importance to a possible strain
of Phoenician blood in him (for the Phoenicians were no
philosophers), yet it is quite likely that through Asia
Minor he may have come in touch with the Far East. He
studied under the cynic Crates, but <b>he</b> did not
neglect other philosophical systems. After many years' study
he opened his own school in a colonnade in Athens called the
Painted Porch, or Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name.
Next to Zeno, the School of the Porch owes most to
Chrysippus (280--207 b.c.), who organised Stoicism into a
system. Of him it was said, 'But for Chrysippus, there had
been no Porch.'
