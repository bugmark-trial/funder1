X. <b>Of</b> Catulus, not to contemn any friend's
expostulation, though <b>unjust,</b> but to strive to reduce
him to his former disposition: freely and heartily to speak
well of all my masters <b>upon</b> any occasion, as it is
reported of Domitius, and Athenodotus: and to love my
children with true affection.
